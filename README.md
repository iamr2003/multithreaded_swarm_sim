# multithreaded_swarm_sim
Building a fast swarm simulation engine, using multithreading and other methods. 
Akin to a particle simulation with customizable physics.
Expanding off of work in done in "Imitating Swarm Behavior from Learning Agent Level Controllers", Musaddequr Rahman et al. 

Long Term goals of trying to build an library that can be pulled into other languages(web via wasm,python, cpp).
